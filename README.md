# Welcome to our github repository for our 3rd semester study group 

When you make changes PLEASE save them under a new name in your local folder before you push them to this repository e.g.,
- Making changes to assignment_1.rmd
- Save it as assignment_1_manu_date.rmd 
This way we do not lose anything and can always go back and look at our previous work 

It makes it easier to sort through the files if you add a message with the date to your commits e.g.,
you have made changes to assignment_1.rmd and now need to push it 
(in your git Bash)
- git add . (remember the space and dot)
- git commit -m "date/message"
- git push 

If you have problems with cloning the repository to your local folder please let me know
